Blockages in centrifugal pumps reduce performance and risk breakdown, so timely detection is essential. This study uses 2D CWT of suction pressure signals and a modified InceptionV3 CNN (ReLUs + ELUs) to classify 35 conditions, raising accuracy from 82% to 95%. Enhanced precision, recall, and F1 underscore its value for predictive maintenance.
